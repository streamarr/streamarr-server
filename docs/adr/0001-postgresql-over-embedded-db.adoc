= ADR 0001: PostgreSQL Over Embedded Database

== Status

Accepted

== Context

Media server applications need a database. Common choices include SQLite (embedded, file-based), H2 (in-memory/embedded Java), and PostgreSQL (client-server).

== Decision

Use PostgreSQL as the sole database for development, testing, and production.

== Consequences

* Custom ENUMs, UUID primary keys, and full-text search available out of the box
* TestContainers ensures dev/prod parity -- no H2 compatibility issues
* Docker required for local development (trivial with `docker compose up -d postgres`)
* Eliminates the class of bugs caused by H2/PostgreSQL behavioral differences
