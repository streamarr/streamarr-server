= ADR 0002: GraphQL Over REST

== Status

Accepted

== Context

The primary client is a tvOS app that needs flexible queries for browsing, searching, and displaying media details. REST would require multiple endpoints or over-fetching.

== Decision

Use GraphQL via Netflix DGS for the API layer.

== Consequences

* Client can request exactly the fields it needs -- reduces payload size for Apple TV
* Relay-style cursor pagination works naturally with infinite scroll UIs
* Single endpoint simplifies client networking
* DGS integrates cleanly with Spring Boot and provides schema-first development
* Streaming endpoints (HLS) remain REST since media players expect plain HTTP
